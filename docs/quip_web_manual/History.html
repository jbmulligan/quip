<h3 class="section">1.1 History</h3>

<p>QuIP has been developed continously over a period
of several decades, under a series of flavors of UNIX. 
The QuIP interpreter is a front end for a number of libraries;
some of these are system libraries, such as X Windows and OpenGL
for image display, and Motif for GUI widgets.  Other libraries
are distributed as part of the QuIP package, and provide support
for various specialized functions, including support for a variety
of hardware devices, and psychophysical experimentation. 
It provides an environment for visual and numerical
computing similar in functionality to Matlab and the like.

<p>The QuIP interpreter has its roots in a simple terminal-based
system to interactively control experiments.  It was designed
to facilitate the interaction and minimize the amount of typing
required of the user.  It only gradually grew into a full-fledged
programming language, and still exhibits various shortcomings. 
At various times, switching to another interpreter (such as Tcl)
was considered, but the loss of some of QuIP's unique features
seemed too high a price to pay.  You can be the judge.
